### Mediterranean-Inspired Grilled Fish Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 4 salmon or tilapia fillets
- 2 lemons (1 sliced, 1 juiced)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Fresh parsley for garnish

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.

2. **Marinate the Fish:**
   - Place the fish fillets in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the fish, ensuring each fillet is well coated. Cover the dish or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, but no more than 30 minutes.

3. **Preheat the Grill:**
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a grill pan, preheat it over medium-high heat on the stove.

4. **Grill the Fish:**
   - Remove the fish from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip off. Place the fish on the preheated grill. Cook for about 4-6 minutes on each side, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. The exact cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fillets.

5. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the grilled fish to a serving platter. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley, if desired. Serve immediately with your favorite Mediterranean sides, such as grilled vegetables, couscous, or a fresh salad.

Enjoy your Mediterranean-inspired grilled fish dinner!
